# Custom NPC Outfits

**Custom NPC Outfits** is a Content Patcher mod which allows creators to readily customize NPCs.
It seperates characters into a collection of layers, allowing for the individual customization of hairstyles, outfits, and accessories that change from day to day.
Characters can change clothes and try new looks, and it's easy to add new pieces to a character's repitoire!

## Features
- Outfits that change on a daily basis
- Easy addition of new items and hairstyles

## Future Plans
- Dymanic outfit shifts based on weather, and season!
- Additional asset types (accessories, clothing types, etc)
- Sprites for all of the vanilla characters!

A guide for adding your own assets will be coming in the future.
